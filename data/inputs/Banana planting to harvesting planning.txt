Introduction: The State of Banana Farming in 2025 🍌
Greetings, farmer brothers, and welcome to Max Kisan. As we begin the new year of 2025, we are focusing on banana cultivation, which is practiced on a large scale in Maharashtra, across India, and in other states.


Within Maharashtra, Jalgaon district is known as the hub of banana production, while Solapur has become the hub for banana exports.


## A Landmark Year of Success & Revolution
The previous year was exceptionally good for banana growers, marking a "revolution" in the banana industry that we are witnessing firsthand.


Historical Context: The success we see today is the fruit of the labor initiated by the respected "Mothe Bhau" Bahuralalji back in 1994-95.


Export Milestone: Last year, over 6 lakh (600,000) tons of bananas were exported.


International Demand: Significant demand for our bananas was generated in numerous international markets.


## The Way Forward: A Call for Strategic Planning
To build on this success, it is crucial to focus on strategic, year-long planning. We must work towards the following goals:


Maintain Crop Health Year-Round: Ensure our banana crops are kept in excellent condition throughout the entire year.


Establish High-Quality Orchards: It is essential to develop and maintain top-tier orchards.


Implement Supply Chain Management: A robust and efficient supply chain is necessary to sustain growth and meet demand.




1. The Need for a Proactive, Year-Round Strategy
To succeed, we must think beyond just cultivation. It's essential to have facilities for export and a system to supply markets based on their needs. We must also be vigilant about disease control, whether it's Sigatoka leaf spot (Karpa), Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), or the future threat of Panama wilt. This requires a knowledgeable, year-round approach to managing the banana crop.


## 2. Current Orchard Status and the Main Winter Challenge ❄️
Currently, as winter begins, our orchards are in various stages:


Monsoon Plantings (Mrug Baug): The bunch emergence (nisava) is underway. In some orchards, it's complete, while in others, the bunches are in the development stage.


Recent Plantings (Kande Baug): These have been largely completed.


The most pressing issue we face today is the proper management of banana orchards during the winter.


## 3. Identifying the Problem: Cold Injury ("Charka") vs. Fungal Blight ("Karpa")
In winter, farmers often see stunted growth and yellowing or scorched leaves. It's crucial to distinguish between two common causes, as many growers confuse them.


Fungal Blight (Karpa): This is a disease. You will see fungal spots or dots on the leaf. These spots merge, and the leaf "burns" or dies.


Cold Injury (Charka): This is not a disease but damage to the leaf cells caused by cold temperatures. The leaf turns yellow suddenly and looks scorched.


Currently, significant cold injury (Charka) is being observed in the Vidarbha region (in areas like Anjangaon Surji, Akot, Morshi, Warud) and in many of our own orchards.


## 4. Essential Winter Management Practices
To combat the effects of the cold, follow these critical steps for irrigation and nutrition.


💧 Irrigation
Do NOT Stop Watering: Continue irrigating the orchard.


Water Quantity: Provide 18-20 liters of water per plant as needed.


Watering Time: Irrigate at night.


Soil Condition: Maintain a proper moisture and air balance (wapsa condition) in the root zone.


🌱 Fertigation (Drip Fertilization)
Applying fertilizers by hand is ineffective in winter because the cold reduces their ability to dissolve in the soil. Fertigation is essential.


Frequency: Provide water-soluble fertilizers through the drip system every fourth day.


Key Nutrients: The schedule should include Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Sulphur (S), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), and Boron (B).


Recommended Regular Schedule:


Urea: 5 kg


12:61:00 (MAP) or Phosphoric Acid: 2 kg of 12:61:00 or 0.5 kg of Phosphoric Acid


00:00:50 (SOP / White Potash): 6.5 kg


Magnesium Sulphate: 1 kg


## 5. Correcting a Common Misconception About Winter Nutrition
There is a common belief among farmers that plants do not absorb nutrients during the winter. This is incorrect.


The Reality: While the morning temperature may be as low as 9°C, the afternoon temperature often rises to 25-26°C.


The Science: Plants actively absorb nutrients once the temperature goes above 16°C.


1. Advanced Cultivation Technology
Method: Use of raised beds, double lateral irrigation, and fertigation.


Benefits: Leads to good stem girth, strong bunch stalks, and overall high-quality banana cultivation.


2. Sapling Management
Challenge: Unavailability of tissue culture saplings (like Jain Tissue Culture) during peak planting season due to last-minute demand.


Solution: Book saplings well in advance to ensure timely availability.


3. Seasonal Planting and Management
April-May Planting (High Summer):


Challenge: Extreme heat, with temperatures reaching up to 47°C.


Solution: Protect young plants by either sowing Sunn Hemp (ताग) on the beds or using crop covers to manage heat stress.


May-July Planting:


Challenge: Young plants in July-August are highly susceptible to Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV).


Solution: Avoid planting maize or cotton near banana fields, as they act as host crops for the virus and its vectors. This has proven effective in controlling CMV in several villages.


4. Disease Management
Karpa (Sigatoka Leaf Spot):


Trigger: Increases with rainfall.


Management:


Maintain clean orchards and good plant nutrition.


Employ preventive sprays before the disease appears, as it is very difficult to control once severe.


Pitting (Fruit Peel Disease):


Timing: Affects bunches emerging in October-November.


Management:


Apply preventive treatments (e.g., Topsin powder, Imida pesticide) directly on the bunch in June-July, just as the hands are opening.


Late-stage intervention during harvest is ineffective.


5. Export Quality and Fruit Care Management
High Demand Periods: October-November and April-May-June.


Practices for Export-Grade Bunches (especially for bunches emerging in Jan-Feb):


Bud Injection: Injecting the male bud with nutrients/chemicals.


Bunch Spray: Applying protective sprays on the bunch.


Flower Removal: Removing the male florets.


Bagging: Using skirting bags for protection.


Hand Selection: Pruning the bunch to keep 9-10 hands for better fruit filling and quality.


6. Major Threat: Fusarium Wilt (Panama Disease)
Status: A deadly, soil-borne disease that has appeared in nearby regions (Rajpipla, Bharuch, Surat, Burhanpur).


Severity: Can survive in soil for over 30 years and has devastated banana industries in countries like the Philippines, Honduras, China, and Australia.


Call to Action: Immediate and serious vigilance is required, even if it's not widespread locally yet.


7. Preventive Measures for Fusarium Wilt
Strict Quarantine Rules:


Vehicle Disinfection: Disinfect the wheels of all vehicles and motorbikes entering villages and farms.


Laborer Hygiene: Provide dedicated, clean footwear to farm laborers or ensure their personal footwear is disinfected before they enter the orchard.


Goal: To prevent the spread of this devastating disease into the banana-growing regions of Maharashtra.




Banana Farming: From Cultivation to Export
Challenges and Planning:


The primary challenge for banana growers today is to protect their plantations without falling into the trap of "peel garden" issues (possibly referring to quality or disease problems).


This requires comprehensive planning, from the moment of planting until harvesting, to ensure the safety and quality of the crop.


Quality and Market Strategy:


Domestic Market: Quality plays a crucial role in the domestic market.


Export Market: Quality is paramount for success in the export market.


Modern Farming Practices and Future Direction:


Farmers are currently implementing practices like tissue culture, drip irrigation, fertigation, fruit care management, and proper packaging.


However, these efforts need to be expanded to achieve an international standard of work.


The future direction for banana growers in the coming year should focus on:


Achieving international standards for packaging.


Improving processes for exporting.


Developing cold storage facilities to store bananas and fill containers.


A Golden Era for Banana Growers:


Taking all these factors into account and approaching them scientifically, the years 2023 and 2024 were a golden age for banana cultivation.


During this time, bananas were sold at a price of ₹3,300 per quintal.


Banana growers celebrated this success by sending their produce to market with great fanfare, including drum beats and DJs.


This period painted a beautiful and memorable picture in the lives of banana farmers.


Here is the translation and structured breakdown of the Marathi text:


Sustainable Management of Banana Farming
The Collective Responsibility:


It's our shared responsibility to ensure the long-term sustainability and preservation of banana farming for the future.


Adopting a Scientific Approach:


To achieve this, we must remain vigilant at every stage.


Instead of focusing on personal opinions or feelings, we should manage banana cultivation by considering:


What science recommends.


What the history of the crop teaches us.
