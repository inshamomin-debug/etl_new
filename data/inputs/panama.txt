Panama Wilt: Fusarium oxysporum f.sp cubense
Symptom:
● Externally, the first obvious signs of disease in most varieties are wilting and a
light yellow colouring of the lower leaves, most prominent around the margins.
They eventually turn a bright yellow colour with dead leaf margins.
● Splitting of the pseudo stem base is a characteristic symptom.
● When a cross-section is cut, the discolouration appears in a circular pattern
around the centre of the rhizome where the infection concentrates due to the
arrangement of the vessels. As symptoms progress into the pseudo-stem,
continuous lines of discolouration are evident when the plant is cut
longitudinally
● The disease is soil borne and the fungus enters the roots through the fine
laterals.
● The pathogen is easily spread by infected rhizomes or suckers, farm implements
or vehicles, irrigation water

MANAGEMENT:

Proper care should be given when planting susceptible
cultivators such Rasthali, Monthan, Karpuravalli,
Kadali, Pachanadan by selecting healthy suckers from
disease fields
Remove and destroy infested plant material after
harvest
Application Bacillus subtilis @ 2.5kg/ha bactericide
can also be applied along with farmyard manure and
neem cake.
About 60 mg of Bacillus subtilis (in a capsule) can be
applied in a 10 cm deep hole made in the corm.
Paring (pralinge removal of roots and outer skin of
corm) and dipping of the suckers in clay slurry and
sprinkled with Carbofuran granules at 40g/corm
Soil drenching of Carbendazim 0.1 per cent solution
around the pseudo stem at bimonthly intervals starting
from five months after planting.
