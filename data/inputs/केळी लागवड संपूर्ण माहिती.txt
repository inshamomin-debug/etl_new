Banana Cultivation: A Guide for Farmers
Introduction:


Speaker: Krishi Doctor Suryakant


Platform: BharatAgri Marathi YouTube Channel


Topic: Banana cultivation guide, focusing on key aspects for Maharashtra.


Ideal Season: The best time to plant bananas in Maharashtra.


Soil and Climate: The type of soil and climate suitable for banana cultivation.


Varieties: The best and most improved banana varieties currently available in Maharashtra.


Planting Method: The proper technique for planting.


Fertilizer Management: How to effectively manage fertilizers for the crop.


When to Plant Bananas
General Guideline: If you have access to water, you can plant bananas at any time of the year.


Common Seasons in Maharashtra:


June-July: A common planting period.


October-November: Another popular season.


February-May: Many plantings are also observed during this time.


Recommendation for Better Prices:


To get the best market rates, the speaker highly recommends planting between December and January.


This timing leads to excellent yields and better prices in the market.


Ideal Conditions for Banana Cultivation
1. Soil Requirements
For a successful banana crop, the soil should have:


Good Drainage: The land should not hold water.


Rich Organic Matter: An organic carbon content of 0.5% to 1% is ideal.


Balanced pH: The soil pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5.


Good Microbial Activity: A high population of beneficial microorganisms is important.


To verify these conditions, it is essential to get a soil test done.


2. Climate Requirements
Bananas are a tropical crop that thrive in a hot and humid climate.


For Leaf Growth: An optimal temperature is 23 to 28°C.


For Fruit Bunch Growth: The best temperature is 29 to 30°C.


Overall: A temperature range of 25 to 32°C is excellent for the crop.


3. Recommended Banana Varieties
There are many good tissue culture varieties from private companies available on the market. Some excellent options include:


Grand Naine


Red Banana


Velchi


Srimanti


Pusrai


Blue Java


Of these, Grand Naine is a proven variety that has shown great results in Maharashtra.


4. Planting Distance (Spacing)
Proper spacing is a crucial factor that is often discussed among farmers. Different spacing methods are used, and each has a different plant density per acre:


6 x 5 ft: Approximately 1,452 plants per acre.


7 x 5 ft: Approximately 1,244 plants per acre.


5 x 5 ft (High-Density Planting): Approximately 1,742 plants per acre.


The speaker's recommendation:


The speaker recommends planting at 6 x 5 ft or 7 x 5 ft.


Wider spacing between rows and plants helps the plant base to become thick, resulting in a higher-quality bunch and increased weight.


With proper management, it is possible to achieve bunch weights of 45 to 50 kg, which is now a common achievement for many farmers.


Therefore, planning the right planting distance is crucial for getting a good yield.


Bed Preparation and Fertilizer Management for Bananas
Bed Dimensions
The ideal height and width of the planting beds depend on the soil type:


Heavy Soil: A bed height of 11 inches is recommended.


Calcareous (Chunakhad) Soil: A bed height of 9 inches is suitable.


Light, Murum Soil: A bed height of 6 inches is sufficient.


The width of the top of the bed should be 2.5 to 3 feet across all soil types.


Fertilizer Management: A Detailed Guide
Bananas are a nutrient-hungry crop, requiring more fertilizer than even sugarcane.


University Recommendation (Per Acre):


Nitrogen (N): 200 kg


Phosphorus (P): 70 kg


Potassium (K): 250 kg


Important Principles:


Don't Apply All at Once: Due to the high quantities needed, the fertilizer should be applied in multiple, split doses rather than all at once in the beds.


Application Methods: You can apply the fertilizer through various methods:


Mixing it into the soil.


Using drip irrigation (fertigation).


Applying some through foliar sprays.


Fertilizer Application Schedule (Basal and Split Doses)
The speaker presents a detailed fertilization schedule, which is shown in a chart on the screen. The entire plan is broken down into five distinct applications to ensure the plants get a steady supply of nutrients throughout their growth cycle.


Basal Dose: Applied at the time of planting.


First Top Dressing ("Bal Bandhani"): Applied 50 to 60 days after planting.


Second Top Dressing ("Mothi Bandhani"): Applied 100 to 120 days after planting.


Third Top Dressing: Applied 150 days after planting.


Fourth Top Dressing: Applied 180 days after planting.


The on-screen chart provides all the details, including:


Which fertilizers to apply.


The specific quantities (dosage).


The benefits of each application.


The exact growth stage for each application.


The speaker strongly advises farmers to take a screenshot of the chart and save it for future reference.


Additionally, the video also includes a chart for the application of water-soluble fertilizers (drip fertigation) at different growth stages. This chart shows the specific grades and dosages of fertilizers to be applied at different intervals.


Fertilization Schedule for Banana Cultivation
The speaker is discussing a detailed fertilization chart that is displayed on the screen. The schedule is divided based on different growth stages of the banana plant.


Growth Stages and Fertilization Schedule:
Root and Vegetative Growth Stage: (Day 15 to 60)


Budding Stage: (Day 61 to 210)


Bunch and Fruit Development Stage: (Day 211 to 325)


The chart provides a detailed plan for what to apply, in what quantity, and at what intervals for each of these four stages.




He advises them to take a screenshot or write down the information in a notebook for future reference.


He also asks viewers to leave their questions in the comments section if they have any doubts, promising to answer them.


He mentions that he is not reading out the entire chart to save time, as the information can be easily understood from the screenshot.
